### Bayesian Linear Regression
#### Task :
Goals for this project are :

 (i) to investigate the effect of the number of examples, the numberof features, and the regularization parameter on the performance of the corresponding algorithms

 (ii) to investigate two methods for model selection in linear regression (evidence maximization and cross validation).

Performance is evaluated on the basis of Mean Square Error

#### Example on sequence of parameter:
```
\python3 pp2.py train-1000-100.csv trainR-1000-100.csv test-1000-100.csv testR-1000-100.csv\
```
Number of Parameter : 4

#### Output:
First graph is for task 1\
Second Graph is for task 2\
After that on output screen results for task 3.1 and task 3.2
